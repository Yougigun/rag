Database Optimization Guide

This document provides comprehensive strategies for optimizing database performance.

Connection Pooling
Connection pooling is essential for high-performance applications. It reduces the overhead of establishing and tearing down database connections. Configure your connection pool with appropriate minimum and maximum connection limits based on your application's concurrency requirements.

Query Optimization
Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand query execution plans. Add indexes on frequently queried columns, especially those used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY statements. Avoid SELECT * statements and only fetch the columns you need.

Index Management
Proper indexing is crucial for query performance. Create composite indexes for queries that filter on multiple columns. Monitor index usage statistics and remove unused indexes to reduce storage overhead and improve write performance.

Query Caching
Implement query result caching for frequently accessed data. Use Redis or Memcached to cache query results with appropriate TTL values. This can reduce database load by 60% for read-heavy applications.

Database Configuration
Tune database configuration parameters based on your workload. For PostgreSQL, adjust shared_buffers, work_mem, and max_connections. For MySQL, configure innodb_buffer_pool_size and query_cache_size appropriately.

Monitoring and Metrics
Set up comprehensive monitoring for database performance metrics including query execution time, connection pool utilization, and slow query logs. Use tools like pganalyze, New Relic, or custom dashboards to track performance over time.
